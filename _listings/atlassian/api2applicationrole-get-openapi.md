        ### About project roles

        [Project roles](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg) are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with projects. In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).

        Project roles can be used in [permission schemes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.

        #### Members and actors

        In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an _actor_. An _actor_ is a group or user associated with a project role.

        Actors may be set as [default members](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg#Managingprojectroles-Specifying'defaultmembers'foraprojectrole) of the project role or set at the project level:

        *   Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
        *   Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a particular project, which may differ from the default actors. This allows you to assign a particular user to different roles in different projects.

        _Note that although a new project role is available to all projects upon creation, any default actors that are associated with the project role are not added to projects that existed prior to the role being created._<
